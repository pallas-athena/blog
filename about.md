No, athena.com is not for sale.  Really.  Even if your girlfriend's name is
Athena.  Even if you have a cool start-up that you really can't tell me about
but that would benefit from the domain.  Even if you are an entrepreneur like me.
No, I'm not interested in discussing why.  Sorry for sounding like a jerk about it,
but I get a couple of requests per week to sell the domain and I've been
saying "no" for 20 years.  It's not likely that I'll say "yes" to you.

And, really. Just don't ask.
